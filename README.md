*Work In Progress, not ready for any kind of use*

Firewheel aims to be a fully-featured libre open source audio graph engine for games and other applications!

## Key Planned Goals

* Modular design that can be run on any backend that provides an audio stream
    * Default backend supporting Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, and WebAssembly
* Flexible audio graph engine (supports any directed, acyclic graph with support for both one-to-many and many-to-one connections)
* A suite of essential built-in audio nodes:
    * gain, stereo panning, and summing
    * versatile sampler
    * spatial positioning (make a sound "emanate" from a point in 3d space)
    * triple buffering for inserting/reading raw samples from any thread
* Custom audio node API allowing for a plethora of 3rd party generators and effects
* Basic [CLAP](https://cleveraudio.org/) plugin hosting (non-WASM only), allowing for more open source and proprietary 3rd party effects and synths
* Silence optimizations (avoid processing if the audio buffer contains all zeros, useful when using "pools" of nodes where the majority of the time nodes are unused)
* Ability to add "sequences" to certain nodes (i.e. automation and sequences of events).
* A general purpose "preset" graph with an easy-to-use interface
* Support for loading a wide variety of audio formats
* Fault tolerance for audio streams (The game shouldn't stop or crash just because the player accidentally unplugged their headphones.)
* Properly respect realtime constraints (no mutexes!)
* C bindings

> Not all of the above features are planned for the first release. See the [Design Document] for more details.

## Motivation

While Firewheel is its own standalone project, we are also working closely with the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine to make it Bevy's default audio engine.

## Get Involved

Join the discussion in the [Firewheel Discord Server](https://discord.gg/m42dPpRm) or in the [Bevy Discord Server](https://discord.gg/bevy) under the `working-groups -> Better Audio` channel!

If you are interested in contributing code, first read the [Design Document] and then visit the [Project Board]() (TODO).
