//! Traits and derive macros for diffing and patching.
//!
//! _Diffing_ is the process of comparing a piece of data to some
//! baseline and generating events to describe the differences.
//! _Patching_ takes these events and applies them to another
//! instance of this data. The [`Diff`] and [`Patch`] traits facilitate _fine-grained_
//! event generation, meaning they'll generate events for
//! only what's changed.
//!
//! In typical usage, [`Diff`] will be called in non-realtime contexts
//! like game logic, whereas [`Patch`] will be called directly within
//! audio processors. Consequently, [`Patch`] has been optimized for
//! maximum performance and realtime predictability.
//!
//! [`Diff`] and [`Patch`] are [derivable](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-03-derivable-traits.html),
//! and most aggregate types should prefer the derive macros over
//! manual implementations since the diffing data model is not
//! yet guaranteed to be stable.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Aggregate types like node parameters can derive
//! [`Diff`] and [`Patch`] as long as each field also
//! implements these traits.
//!
//! ```
//! use firewheel_core::diff::{Diff, Patch};
//!
//! #[derive(Diff, Patch)]
//! struct MyParams {
//!     a: f32,
//!     b: (bool, bool),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The derived implementation produces fine-grained
//! events, making it easy to keep your audio processors in sync
//! with the rest of your code with minimal overhead.
//!
//! ```
//! # use firewheel_core::diff::{Diff, Patch, PathBuilder};
//! # #[derive(Diff, Patch, Clone, PartialEq, Debug)]
//! # struct MyParams {
//! #     a: f32,
//! #     b: (bool, bool),
//! # }
//! let mut params = MyParams {
//!     a: 1.0,
//!     b: (false, false),
//! };
//! let mut baseline = params.clone();
//!
//! // A change to any arbitrarily nested parameter
//! // will produce a single event.
//! params.b.0 = true;
//!
//! let mut event_queue = Vec::new();
//! params.diff(&baseline, PathBuilder::default(), &mut event_queue);
//!
//! // When we apply this patch to another instance of
//! // the same type, it will be brought in sync.
//! baseline.apply(MyParams::patch_event(&event_queue[0]).unwrap());
//! assert_eq!(params, baseline);
//!
//! ```
//!
//! Both traits can also be derived on enums.
//!
//! ```
//! # use firewheel_core::diff::{Diff, Patch, PathBuilder};
//! #[derive(Diff, Patch, Clone, PartialEq)]
//! enum MyParams {
//!     Unit,
//!     Tuple(f32, f32),
//!     Struct { a: f32, b: f32 },
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! However, note that enums will only perform coarse diffing. If a single
//! field in a variant changes, the entire variant will still be sent.
//! As a result, you can accidentally introduce allocations
//! in audio processors by including types that allocate on clone.
//!
//! ```
//! # use firewheel_core::diff::{Diff, Patch, PathBuilder};
//! #[derive(Diff, Patch, Clone, PartialEq)]
//! enum MaybeAllocates {
//!     A(Vec<f32>), // Will cause allocations in `Patch`!
//!     B(f32),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! [`Clone`] types are permitted because [`Clone`] does
//! not always imply allocation. For example, consider
//! the type:
//!
//! ```
//! use firewheel_core::{collector::ArcGc, sample_resource::SampleResource};
//!
//! # use firewheel_core::diff::{Diff, Patch, PathBuilder};
//! #[derive(Diff, Patch, Clone, PartialEq)]
//! enum SoundSource {
//!     Sample(ArcGc<dyn SampleResource>), // Will _not_ cause allocations in `Patch`.
//!     Frequency(f32),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This bound may be restricted to [`Copy`] in the future.
//!
//! # Macro attributes
//!
//! [`Diff`] and [`Patch`] each accept a single attribute, `skip`, on
//! struct fields. Any field annotated with `skip` will not receive
//! diffing or patching, which may be useful for atomically synchronized
//! types.
//! ```
//! use firewheel_core::{collector::ArcGc, diff::{Diff, Patch}};
//! use core::sync::atomic::AtomicUsize;
//!
//! #[derive(Diff, Patch)]
//! struct MultiParadigm {
//!     normal_field: f32,
//!     #[diff(skip)]
//!     atomic_field: ArcGc<AtomicUsize>,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Data model
//!
//! Diffing events are represented as `(data, path)` pairs. This approach
//! provides a few important advantages. For one, the fields within nearly
//! all Rust types can be uniquely addressed with index paths.
//!
//! ```
//! # use firewheel_core::diff::{Diff, Patch};
//! #[derive(Diff, Patch, Default)]
//! struct MyParams {
//!     a: f32,
//!     b: (bool, bool),
//! }
//!
//! let params = MyParams::default();
//!
//! params.a;   // [0]
//! params.b.0; // [1, 0]
//! params.b.1; // [1, 1]
//! ```
//!
//! Since these paths can be arbitrarily long, you can arbitrarily
//! nest implementors of [`Diff`] and [`Patch`].
//!
//! ```
//! # use firewheel_core::diff::{Diff, Patch};
//! # #[derive(Diff, Patch, Default)]
//! # struct MyParams {
//! #     a: f32,
//! #     b: (bool, bool),
//! # }
//! #[derive(Diff, Patch)]
//! struct Aggregate {
//!     a: MyParams,
//!     b: MyParams,
//!     // Indexable types work great too!
//!     collection: [MyParams; 8],
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Furthermore, since we build up paths during calls to
//! [`Diff`], the derive macros and implementations only need
//! to worry about _local indexing._ And, since the paths
//! are built only during [`Diff`], we can traverse them
//! highly performantly during [`Patch`] calls in audio processors.
//!
//! Firewheel provides a number of primitive types in [`ParamData`]
//! that cover most use-cases for audio parameters. For anything
//! not covered in the concrete variants, you can insert arbitrary
//! data into [`ParamData::Any`]. Since this only incurs allocations
//! during [`Diff`], this will still be generally performant.
//!
//! # Preserving invariants
//!
//! Firewheel's [`Patch`] derive macro cannot make assurances about
//! your type's invariants. If two types `A` and `B` have similar structures:
//!
//! ```
//! struct A {
//!     pub field_one: f32,
//!     pub field_two: f32,
//! }
//!
//! struct B {
//!     special_field_one: f32,
//!     special_field_two: f32,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Then events produced for `A` are also valid for `B`.
//!
//! Receiving events produced by the wrong type is unlikely. Most
//! types will not need special handling to preserve invariants.
//! However, if your invariants are safety-critical, you _must_
//! implement [`Patch`] manually.
